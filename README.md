# Star_Wars_Favorites_Analysis
A fun project exploring America's favorite characters from Star Wars

While waiting for Star Wars: The Force Awakens to come out, the team at [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/) became interested in answering some questions about Star Wars fans. In particular, they wondered: does the rest of America realize that __“The Empire Strikes Back”__ is clearly the best of the bunch?

The team surveyed Star Wars fans using the online tool SurveyMonkey and received 835 total responses, which you can download from 

`star_wars.csv` The file from FiveThirtyEight survey which can be found on [their GitHub repository ](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey).
